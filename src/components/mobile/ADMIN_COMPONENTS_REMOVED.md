# Mobile Admin Components Removed

These mobile admin components were removed as admin functionality was stripped from the iOS app:

## Removed Files:
- MobileAddCommunityPage.tsx
- MobileAddUnitsPage.tsx
- MobileAdminPage.tsx
- MobileTemplatesPage.tsx

## Impact:
- Streamlined iOS app to inspector-focused functionality only
- Removed admin-level UI components
- Simplified navigation flow
