  ðŸ“‹ Performance Optimization Roadmap - Next Phases

  Phase 2: Low-Risk Improvements (Next Session)

  2.1 Scroll Performance Optimization

  - Replace direct scroll listeners with IntersectionObserver
   in MobileInspectionFormPage
  - Throttle scroll events to 16ms (60fps) for smoother
  scrolling
  - Expected: 95% scroll performance improvement (12fps â†’
  60fps)

  2.2 Expensive Calculations Memoization

  - Add useMemo for filter/sort operations in:
    - Properties filtering by search query
    - Inspection status calculations
    - Progress calculations in inspection form
  - Expected: Faster list rendering and search

  2.3 Image/Photo Performance

  - Implement lazy loading for inspection item photos
  - Add image compression before storage
  - Optimize thumbnail generation
  - Expected: 50% reduction in memory usage

  Phase 3: Structural Changes (Future Sessions)

  3.1 Component Splitting

  - Break down 451-line MobileInspectionFormPage into:
    - InspectionFormHeader (progress, navigation)
    - InspectionSection (individual sections)
    - InspectionItem (individual form items)
    - InspectionActions (completion, camera)
  - Expected: Better code maintainability, targeted
  re-renders

  3.2 Virtualization

  - Add virtualization for long lists (properties,
  inspections)
  - Use react-window or similar for 100+ item lists
  - Expected: Constant performance regardless of list size

  3.3 Code Splitting & Lazy Loading

  - Lazy load inspection form component
  - Split report generation into separate bundle
  - Expected: Faster initial app load

  Phase 4: Advanced Optimizations (Optional)

  4.1 State Management

  - Consider Zustand/Redux for complex state
  - Implement optimistic updates
  - Expected: More predictable state flow

  4.2 Bundle Analysis

  - Analyze and optimize bundle size
  - Remove unused dependencies
  - Expected: Faster app startup
