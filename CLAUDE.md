## Core Features Working

### âœ… Complete Inspection Workflow
- **Create inspections** with template selection and database recording
- **Fill out forms** with ratings, notes, and photo capture per item
- **Camera integration** - multiple photos per inspection item with thumbnails
- **Finalize and save** all itemResponses to database
- **View detailed results** - click completed inspections for full audit trail

### âœ… Live Database Integration
- **Dashboard** - real-time community (4) and property (58+) counts
- **Properties** - live data with search, filtering, and status tracking
- **Inspections** - complete database CRUD operations
- **API optimization** - efficient data loading with fallback handling

### âœ… Advanced Photo System
- **Capacitor Camera** integration with native mobile camera access
- **Web development** support with HTML file input fallback
- **Per-item management** - multiple photos per inspection item
- **Platform detection** - automatic native/web camera selection
- **Photo galleries** - view photos attached to specific items

### âœ… Modern UX Patterns
- **Mobile-first** responsive design optimized for touch
- **Loading states** with skeleton animations and network awareness
- **Error handling** with graceful fallbacks and recovery
- **Real-time updates** reflecting current database state

## Architecture

### Component Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/mobile/    # Mobile-specific pages
â”œâ”€â”€ components/ui/        # Reusable UI components  
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/               # Custom React hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ services/            # API and data services
â””â”€â”€ contexts/            # React context providers
```

### Key Technical Patterns
- **TypeScript strict mode** with comprehensive type safety
- **Network-aware UI** components with offline graceful degradation
- **Optimistic updates** with error handling and rollback
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (iOS/Android native + web development)
