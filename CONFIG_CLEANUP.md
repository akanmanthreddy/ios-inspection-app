# Configuration and Documentation Cleanup

## Removed Files:
- .env (not needed for mock data app)
- API_INTEGRATION_README.md (legacy documentation)  
- SUPABASE_SETUP.md (not using Supabase currently)
- _env_example.tsx (not needed)
- config/env.ts (not used by current implementation)

## Impact:
- Removed unused configuration files
- Cleaned up legacy documentation
- Simplified project structure

## Note:
The current iOS app uses mock data from `/services/api.ts` and doesn't require external configuration files. When ready to implement real backend integration, these can be added back as needed.
